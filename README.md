This project dives into sentiment analysis of movie reviews, using the Kaggle dataset enriched with NLP features like unigrams, bigrams, POS tagging, and LIWC-based sentiment lexicons. I have built and evaluated multiple models, including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, to classify sentiment effectively. Through data visualizations and feature engineering, I gained insights into text data, optimizing models for accuracy and revealing patterns in movie reviews.
